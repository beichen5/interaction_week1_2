    	<p>". . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German.""He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart."</p>
        
        <p>The beginning of my story caught my attention by using the ellipsis. It is really different from other story that will tell the readers the background of the story in te beginning. It lacks the guidance and makes te readers feel like enter a maze by mistake. In the end, Borges also didn't write about the certain outcome of Yu Tsun. The readers only know Yu Tsun's remorse after his arrest instead of the details of arrest. The special beginning and ending make readers feel like entering the confused environment with Yu Tsun together and don't know how would the things happen.</p>
