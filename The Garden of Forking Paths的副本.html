        <p style="font-size:20px"> Reflection:</p>
        <p>The story talks about Yu Tsun, the protagonist who was a spy for Germany in Britain during the First World War, killed the sinologist Albert in order to inform his German superiors of important information when his companions were arrested and he was hunted down. It seems like Borges created a detective story by using the form Yu Tsun's confession in prison after his arrest. But actually, it's more about thinking on the relationship between human and time. "The garden of forking paths" indicates that the different choices that human may face in their life and each choice can bring people to different outcomes. </p>
